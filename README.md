##Project: SQL Symphony â€“ Analyzing a Music Store Database

Hey everyone, excited to share my latest SQL project where I explored a music store database using PostgreSQL.


What I did:
Queried customer and invoice data to analyze sales trends
Used JOINS, GROUP BY, and Window Functions to extract insights
Explored artist and track details to find the most popular genres
Optimized queries for better performance


Key Learnings:
Importance of Database Relationships (ERD)
How to efficiently fetch and analyze large datasets
The power of PostgreSQL functions and indexing
If you are into SQL, data analytics, or music, check out my project. Would love to hear your thoughts.
